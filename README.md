This is my personal website. Everything is basically from the [Particle Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/nrandecker/particle).

- The things (text and images and such) are all in _includes/
- The styles are in src/styles/

Run `sass src/styles/main.scss assets/css/main.css` to produce the .css

Devicons are [here](https://devicon.dev/).

Font Awsome is [here](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/).
